The learning rate $\\alpha$  determines how rapidly we update the parameters. If the learning rate is too large we may \"overshoot\" the optimal value. Similarly, if it is too small we will need too many iterations to converge to the best values. That's why it is crucial to use a well-tuned learning rate.\n\nLet's compare the learning curve of our model with several choices of learning rates. Run the cell below. This should take about 1 minute. Feel free also to try different values than the three we have initialized the `learning_rates` variable to contain, and see what happens. "

You have to check if there is possibly overfitting. It happens when the training accuracy is a lot higher than the test accuracy.\n- In deep learning, we usually recommend that you: \n    - Choose the learning rate that better minimizes the cost function.\n    - If your model overfits, use other techniques to reduce overfitting.
